    What is the Highest Price Bitcoin Has Reached?

Among asset classes, Bitcoin has had one of the most volatile trading histories. The cryptocurrency’s first price increase occurred in 2010 when the value of a single Bitcoin jumped from around $0.0008 to $0.08. It has undergone several rallies and crashes since then. Some have compared the cryptocurrency (and its price movements) to the fad for Beanie Babies during the 1980s while others have drawn parallels between Bitcoin and the Dutch Tulip Mania of the 17th century. 

The price changes for Bitcoin alternately reflect investor enthusiasm and dissatisfaction with its promise. Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s inventor, designed it for use as a medium for daily transactions and a way to circumvent the traditional banking infrastructure after the 2008 financial collapse. While the cryptocurrency has yet to gain mainstream traction as a currency, it has begun to pick up steam through a different narrative—as a store of value and a hedge against inflation.

Though this new narrative may prove to hold more merit, the price fluctuations of the past primarily stemmed from retail investors and traders betting on an ever-increasing price without much grounding in reason or facts. But Bitcoin's price story has changed in recent times. Institutional investors are trickling in after the maturing of cryptocurrency markets and regulatory agencies are crafting rules specifically for the crypto. While Bitcoin price still remains volatile, it is now a function of an array of factors within the mainstream economy, as opposed to being influenced by speculators looking for quick profits through momentum trades. </p>
